# World-Of-Stone
My first Modpack Attempt

This is a Post Apocalyptic modpack. I am attempting to make a hostile, and resource free, world that requires various mods to restore the world to it's former glory.
I am hoping to add a mod that will change the water into a radioactive water, and a filtering system that will be needed to be able to grow crops. The radioactive water would kill any plants in the hydration range of the pool. It would also cause damage to any player unlucky enough to fall into it.
I am using ex nihilo creatio as the basic resource aquisition for this pack, and using better questing to control the pathways for players to progress through.
If you are new to modded minecraft, I intend to make this a way to learn some of the tips and tricks for world progression.

I am also trying to keep the changing to recipes and such to a minimum, and only what is needed to maintain a progression standad.
